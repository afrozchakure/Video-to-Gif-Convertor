# Video-to-Gif-Convertor
A Simple Video to Gif Convertor

In the path provide the path to the video you want to convert into a gif.

You may try to convert your file into some other format as well by changing the input variables during function call.

Try to convert videos less than 10 MB (less than 10 seconds 360p) otherwise the gif you'll get will be very large file (>100MB).

Once the file has been converted to a .gif file, try to optimize using an online gif optimizer to reduce its size.

When done you'll have your own self-made gif. Next share it with your friends and do tell them you created it using a simple python script.

Enjoy!!
